# Leaflet Popup Modifier
A small plugin for leaflet which allows the author to apply removable or editable options to a popup

## Installation


## Using the plugin




## Planned improvements:
Currently the removal button says "Remove this marker," but not every popup originates from a marker.  Plans to change the word 'marker' to 'circle,' 'polygon,' 'line,' etc., automatically based on the source type in the works.

# React Leaflet Editable Popup
A small plugin for leaflet which allows the author to make a popup editable.  You can also use the popup to remove its source.  This is adapted from [leaflet-popup-modifier](https://github.com/slutske22/leaflet-popup-modifier) to work with React-Leaflet.

## Installation


## Using the plugin




## Planned improvements:
Currently the removal button says "Remove this marker," but not every popup originates from a marker.  Plans to change the word 'marker' to 'circle,' 'polygon,' 'line,' etc., automatically based on the source type in the works.
